# kak-lean To Do
- add a few more kind of run commands
  - run and print all output, even if successful
  - run whole file regardless of where cursor is

- namespace blocks should autocomplete the name (snippets?) and auto-indent

- screen moves when doing `=` for formatting. fix this

- if we have a hook that fires when 1) a space was pressed in insert mode,
  2) at some point in the past a \ was pressed, then we could quickly replace
  LaTeX-style inputs with their unicode versions.
